[General]
# You can choose 2 channel or 4 channel mode.
# 4 channels uses front channels for speakers and rear channels as headphones.
# 2 channels only has headphones output (with in-game volume bypassed).
Channels=2

# 16 or 24 bit integer and 32 bit float output are supported.
# If you don't know what this means, you should leave it at 16.
# On some versions of Windows floating point samples may increase latency.
Bit_Depth=16

# This can be WASAPI, DirectSound, or ASIO.
# ASIO doesn't use the buffer settings. Use ASIO config instead.
Backend=WASAPI

[Buffer]
# Sets the requested buffer size in milliseconds.
# Try increasing this if audio stutters or desyncs.
# WASAPI will usually provide a larger buffer than specified.
# You can check the actual buffer size by enabling debug_component.
Buffer_Size=10

# Sets how many periods to use.
# Fewer periods = lower latency, but it may cause issues.
# You probably shouldn't set this below 2, and increasing it probably isn't necessary.
Periods=2

[ASIO]
# Sets the device ID.
# 0=first device(...), -1=first available device
Device=-1

# When set to 1 the ASIO driver config will open alongside the game.
# Use this to adjust output settings, then disable it.
Show_Config=0
