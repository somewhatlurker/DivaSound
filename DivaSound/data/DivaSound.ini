[Buffer]
# Sets the requested buffer size in milliseconds.
# WASAPI will usually provide a larger buffer than specified.
# You can check the actual buffer size by enabling debug_component.
Buffer_Size=10

# Sets how many periods to use.
# Fewer periods = lower latency, but it may cause some issues.
# You probably shouldn't set this below 2, and increasing it probably isn't necessary.
