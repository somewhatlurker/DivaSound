[General]
# You can choose 2 channel or 4 channel mode.
# 4 channel mode uses front channels as speakers output and rear channels as headphones output.
# 2 channel mode only has headphones output (with in-game volume bypassed).
Channels=2

# 16 bit integer and 32 bit float output is supported.
# If you don't know what this means, you should probably leave it at 16.
Bit_Depth=16

[Buffer]
# Sets the requested buffer size in milliseconds.
# Try increasing this if audio stutters or desyncs.
# WASAPI will usually provide a larger buffer than specified.
# You can check the actual buffer size by enabling debug_component.
Buffer_Size=10

# Sets how many periods to use.
# Fewer periods = lower latency, but it may cause some issues.
# You probably shouldn't set this below 2, and increasing it probably isn't necessary.
Periods=2
